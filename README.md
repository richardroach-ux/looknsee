## This is my personal portfolio site, in which I will showcase Communication and Web design work I have completed recently. Older work will be archived here to serve as a point of reflection.

### It is intended for the site to have two main purposes:
First, showcase design case studies that are visual-first, communicating craft and execution with minimal explanation.
The second is to supplement these case studies by displaying a text-led breakdown of these case studies, separate from the case studies but closely coupled. This is for the design nerds, or people curious about the design process, the tools used, the timeframe, etc.
