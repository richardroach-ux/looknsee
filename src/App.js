          <p>My name is Richard, I'm a Communication and Web Designer based in beautiful TƒÅmaki Makaurau, New Zealand.
          <br></br><br></br>Look&See is my design portfolio showcasing projects I've found rewarding, and the work behind the work.
          <br></br>It's a deep dive into my process as a designer and all the tangents and explorations that come before the finished outcomes.</p>
          <p>I believe in design driven by detail; by care, craft and collaboration.</p>
          {/* <p>After graduating from AUT with a Bachelor of Communication Design in 2018 I returned to study both at Whitecliffe and Yoobee, this time focusing on digital design.</p>
          <p>As a result I am comfortable across both print and digital and my work reflects the value this range of study has given me.</p> */}
          <p>I'm available for freelance work while I look for a role at a creative agency. Wink wink.<br></br><br></br>#openforwork</p>
