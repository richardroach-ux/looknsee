          <p>Kia Ora! My name is Richard, I'm a Communication and Web Designer based in Takapuna, in beautiful TƒÅmaki Makaurau, New Zealand.</p>
          <p>Look&See is my design portfolio showcasing projects I've found rewarding while also revealing the 'behind-the-scenes'.</p>
          <p>I want it to be a deep dive into my process as a designer, and all the tangents and explorations that come before the finished outcomes.</p>
          <p>I believe in design driven by detail; by care, craft and collaboration.</p>

          <p>I am currently #openforwork, and available for freelance work while I look for a creative role at a creative agency.</p>
